# Frontend data - High school of Amsterdam

In this project I will research the possibilities of how I can make meaningful interaction in my data from [Functional programming](https://github.com/timruiterkamp/functional-programming.git)

The base from functional programming is a filtered data structure where book titles from a certain genre where looked up by a scraper to retrieve their value.


The product van be found here: [https://frontend-data.netlify.com](https://frontend-data.netlify.com)

## Possible interactive solutions üïµÔ∏è

* Show the amount of books, divided in cheap, medium, expensive and mixed, that are needed to retrieve the subscription value. 
* Filter by different genres (they need to retrieved from the scraper)   
* Show the amount of pages a book contains in opposite of other books with the same price range 
* Range slider to adjust the price range of books  
* How many books do you need to reach county debts 
* How many books do you need to travel 1 time around the world and what would this cost?
* How many books about military can you buy with the total expense of arms (per continent)
